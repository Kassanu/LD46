Submission for Ludum Dare 46 - Keep it alive

# Story
Your friend has fallen ill, collect food while fighting off zombies. But you need to be quick your friend won't last long. Return with enough food (and often) to save your friend.

# Controls
**A** and **D** to move left and right  
**Space** to jump  
**Left Click**/**Left Control** to shoot  
**F** to melee  
**E** to interact  
**C** to eat to recover health

I liked this concept of having to take care of someone and not really have an idea of how well they are doing when you are out. I felt like while playing it gave a sense of urgency and fear that you could come home and find your friend dead. If I had more time I would like to have put in some more metroidvania aspects, like puzzles and power ups that would unlock new areas. I think it could work well as a full game (with much better balancing).

Thank you for playing!
